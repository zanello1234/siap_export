# Contributing to SIAP Export

We love your input! We want to make contributing to SIAP Export as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `17.0`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the LGPL-3 Software License

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/zanello1234/siap_export/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/zanello1234/siap_export/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
